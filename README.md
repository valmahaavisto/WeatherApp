The Weather App is a application that provides real-time weather information for different locations. Users can quickly check the current weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and other relevant details. User can also add locations to favorites.

Throughout this project, we learned how to create a user-friendly application with a graphical interface. We figured out how to make the app talk to a server, fetch real data using API calls, and save it in a .txt format. Plus, we gained hands-on experience in reading data back from a file. 

Technologies used:

- Java: coding
- Maven: building and dependency management
- JavaFX: GUI
- JUnit: testing

To use the Weather App, you need to obtain an API key from Weather API Provider. Once you have the key, replace the placeholder in the code with your actual API key.
