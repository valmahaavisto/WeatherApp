\section{Software Structure}

The WeatherApp consists of three main classes: WeatherApp (GUI), Events (event handlin) and API (API calls). Additionally there are classess: LocationWeather (for one locations weather information), Weather (One locations weather foracast or current of a certain timestamp) and Coord (stores latitude and longitude of a place).

\subsection{Class Responsibilities}


\texttt{WeatherApp.java} is responsible for handling GUI element placement and event handling. It creates an \texttt{Events} object that manages storing favorites, the last searched location, and communicates with the API through an \texttt{API.java} object. The \texttt{Events.java} class implements the \texttt{iEvents.java} interface. 

The \texttt{API} class, implementing the \texttt{iAPI.java} interface, retrieves JSON files containing current weather data and forecasts for given locations from \texttt{openweathermap.org}. Additionally, it identifies coordinates and proper names for a given search term (up to 5 results).

These resulting JSONs are parsed to create \texttt{Weather} class instances, storing weather conditions (current or forecast) for a specific timestamp. \texttt{Events.java} then stores these \texttt{Weather.java} objects into \texttt{LocationWeather.java} class instances, representing all weather information for a particular location. For example, the current weather and a 4-day forecast for Tampere, Finland. The \texttt{Coord.java} class stores the latitude and longitude of a given location.

Refer to the Javadoc documentation for detailed information on the various functions within these classes.


\section{Project Functionality}

The WeatherApp encompasses a range of essential functionalities, each detailed in the "User Manual" section:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Location Search:} Retrieve weather information from openweathermap.org by searching for a specific location.
	\item \textbf{Current Weather Display:} View real-time weather details for a selected location.
	\item \textbf{Forecast Information:} Access a comprehensive forecast, including hourly breakdowns for the current day and daily maximum and minimum temperatures for the next four days. Additionally, receive weather descriptions.
	\item \textbf{Favorites Management:} Easily add or remove locations to and from the favorites list for quick access.
	\item \textbf{Persistent Data:} Save the last accessed location, search history and user favorites to a file, ensuring automatic retrieval and display when the application is relaunched.
	\item \textbf{Unit Customization:} Seamlessly switch between metric and imperial units to suit individual preferences.
	\item \textbf{Search history:} Five last searchwords are saved and displayed under the search bar when typing a searchword.
	\item \textbf{Junit tests:} Junit test classes have been created for Events and API. Junit test compiles without errors.
\end{itemize}

\section{User Manual}

This section provides a brief introduction to using the WeatherApp program.

\subsection{Running the app}

The main program is \texttt{WeatherApp.java}. Execute this file, and a graphical user interface should appear.

\subsection{Main window}

When on the main screen of WeatherApp, you can view the current weather conditions for the last accessed location. If no location has been accessed before, the program starts from main window that includes a greeting message instead. Under the current conditions, a forecast for the current day and the next four days is displayed. Clicking on these days reveals a detailed description of the weather conditions for each day (time, description icon, temperature, wind direction, wind speed, and humidity).

\subsection{Searching for a location}

Utilize the topmost search bar to search for a location by entering its name (e.g., Tampere) and clicking Enter "Search". A list of locations matching the search key is presented (up to five locations). By clicking on a result, the user is presented with the weather information and forecast for the chosen place on the main window, as previously described. Five last search results are shown under the search bar when typing a searchword.

\subsection{Favorites}

The user can add a location to favorites by pressing "Add to favorites" or remove a location by pressing "Remove from favorites." Favorites are presented at the top in the "Favorites" section. From this list, the user can choose a location and receive its weather information. (Access more favorites by pressing "more.")

\subsection{Units}

There are two units available: metric or imperial. In metric, the temperature is in Celsius and wind speed in m/s. In imperial, the units are in Fahrenheit, and wind speed is in miles/hour.

\subsection{Closing program}

When the program is closed, the last viewed location, search history and favorites are saved to memory and retrieved when the program is relaunched.


\subsection{Additional features}

Search history is shown under the search bar when typing a searchword. Only the matches of the last 5 searches that match the currently typed keyword are shown. Search history is saved to a txt file when app is closed and is read back when app is opened.

Additional unit support is available. Available units are metric and imperial. They can be changed from upper right corner.




\section{Known Bugs and Missing Features}

\noindent 1. Openweathermap.org doesn't always retrieve rain information if it should. 

\noindent 2. Weather icons are sometimes different when calling in metric units vs imperial units. weathermap.org gives different IDs.
