\section{Software Structure}

The WeatherApp consists of three main classes: WeatherApp (GUI), Events (event handlin) and API (API calls).

\subsection{Class Responsibilities}


\texttt{WeatherApp.java} is responsible for handling GUI element placement and event handling. It creates an \texttt{Events} object that manages storing favorites, the last searched location, and communicates with the API through an \texttt{API.java} object. The \texttt{Events.java} class implements the \texttt{iEvents.java} interface. 

The \texttt{API} class, implementing the \texttt{iAPI-java} interface, retrieves JSON files containing current weather data and forecasts for given locations from \texttt{openweathermap.org}. Additionally, it identifies coordinates and proper names for a given search term (up to 5 results).

These resulting JSONs are parsed to create \texttt{Weather} class instances, storing weather conditions (current or forecast) for a specific timestamp. \texttt{Events.java} then stores these \texttt{Weather.java} objects into \texttt{LocationWeather.java} class instances, representing all weather information for a particular location. For example, the current weather and a 4-day forecast for Tampere, Finland. The \texttt{Coord.java} class stores the latitude and longitude of a given location.

Refer to the Javadoc documentation for detailed information on the various functions within these classes.


\section{Project Functionality}

The WeatherApp encompasses a range of essential functionalities, each detailed in the "User Manual" section:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Location Search:} Retrieve weather information from openweathermap.org by searching for a specific location.
	\item \textbf{Current Weather Display:} View real-time weather details for a selected location.
	\item \textbf{Forecast Information:} Access a comprehensive forecast, including hourly breakdowns for the current day and daily maximum and minimum temperatures for the next four days. Additionally, receive weather descriptions.
	\item \textbf{Favorites Management:} Easily add or remove locations to and from the favorites list for quick access.
	\item \textbf{Persistent Data:} Save the last accessed location and user favorites to a file, ensuring automatic retrieval and display when the application is relaunched.
	\item \textbf{Unit Customization:} Seamlessly switch between metric and imperial units to suit individual preferences.
\end{itemize}

\section{User Manual}

This section provides a brief introduction to using the WeatherApp program.

\subsection{Running the app}

The main program is \texttt{WeatherApp.java}. Execute this file, and a graphical user interface should appear.

\begin{figure}[h]

    \caption{Main window launched when the program is run}
    \label{fig:main_window}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Main window}

When on the main screen of WeatherApp, you can view the current weather conditions for the last accessed location. Under the current conditions, a forecast for the current day and the next four days is displayed. Clicking on these days reveals a detailed description of the weather conditions for each day (time, description icon, temperature, wind direction, wind speed, and rain probability).

\subsection{Searching for a location}

Utilize the topmost search bar to search for a location by entering its name (e.g., Tampere) and pressing Enter (or Search). A list of locations matching the search key is presented (up to five locations). By clicking on a result, the user is presented with the weather information and forecast for the chosen place on the main window, as previously described.

\subsection{Favorites}

The user can add a location to favorites by pressing "Add to favorites" or remove a location by pressing "Remove from favorites." Favorites are presented at the top in the "Favorites" section. From this list, the user can choose a location and receive its weather information. (Access more favorites by pressing "more.")

\subsection{Units}

There are two units available: metric or imperial. In metric, the temperature is in Celsius and wind speed in m/s. In imperial, the units are in Fahrenheit, and wind speed is in miles/hour.

\subsection{Closing program}

When the program is closed, the last viewed location and favorites are saved to memory and retrieved when the program is relaunched.
